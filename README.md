# Early-Heart-attack-risk-detection
To detect heart attack risks at the early stages using both camera based and manual data.


Decoding the Heart’s Whisper: AI for Preemptive Cardiac Care aims to detect early signs of heart attacks using a combination of camera-based monitoring and manual data entry. The system captures real-time physiological signals—such as facial color changes, pulse variations, and breathing patterns—through a standard camera, while users provide health information like symptoms, lifestyle, and medical history. These inputs are analyzed by an AI model that predicts the likelihood of an early-stage cardiac event and alerts users when risk levels are high. This hybrid approach offers a non-invasive, affordable, and accessible method for early cardiac screening, supporting timely intervention and prevention of severe heart conditions.
